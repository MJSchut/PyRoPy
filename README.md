This is a python roguelike that I'll be maintaining as a hobby project.
Parts of this will follow the libtcod tutorial.

UPDATE log
- 0.01d: Added run.bat and a python 2.7 release. Just click and run the (not yet) game.
Message system has been added, so has a basic combat system.
- 0.01c: Camera system has been added. Walls are bumpable, pieces of fungus are killable.
- 0.01b: Added an Entity system. Now we are getting OOP. Documentation..
is still a bit lacking. I'll work on it once we get some semblance of a 
game going.
- 0.01a: Bare bones, an @ moves around the screen. Nothing much to see
yet.
