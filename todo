- Help menu

- Replace HP system with blood system
    - Stops instant death.
    - Bleeding if you are wounded; can be internal
    - Leave blood on tiles; if external wound
    - Bleeding reduces over time (Think of a nice log function for this... Probably y ~ log(x) would do)
    - Fire cauterizes wounds, the higher the damage, the less the DoT

- Add limb removal;
    - Check if limb is vital; if so; die (only happens in extreme cases, no 1HKOs in this game)
    - Check if limb had other limbs attached to it; if so; remove them too
    - Drop limb on floor
        - Possible source of food
        - Change name of the corpse dropped (desecrated)

- Add limb growth (through magical means);
    - Add functions to add extra limbs
    - Add mutation potions that provide extra arms
        - If you grow extra arms, can't wear metal torso armor any longer
            - Maybe if you have some kind of welding/metalworking skill you can cut extra holes in the armor
                - Reduces defence by 20%, but allows you to wear it again.
        - However, you can wield extra items if you grow extra arms (i.e., more attacks)

# - Add decal;
    ## - Each creature either has blood
        ## - Blood color is set to red by default, can change

        - Dissociate between internal wounds (no blood) and external wounds
