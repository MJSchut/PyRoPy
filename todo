## = Done
#  = Working on it

Planned Features
## - Greyed out areas that have been explored previously;

## - Put GUI on side rather than down.
    ## - Fix message log

- Help menu

- Main menu

- Look command

- Inventory management; don't use slots
    - Use a volume/weight approach
    - Stack items that you have multiples of
        - The stack is only in the menu

- Tiles unidentify themselves slowly over time (represents some memory restrictions)
    - Not quite sure about this one... could be very unfun.

- Identification system
    - Only see item appearance at first
    - Potions can be identified by drinking
    - Equipment by equiping
    ## - Potion effects are picked from a pre-set color

- Projectile system
    - Throwing
    - Flame throwing
    - Magma throwing, fuck yes.

- Replace HP system with blood system
    - Bleeding if you are wounded; can be internal
    - Leave blood on tiles; if external wound
    - Bleeding reduces over time (Log/exp/1/(exp(-x))?)
    - Fire cauterizes wounds, the higher the damage, the less the DoT

- Add limb removal;
    - Check if limb is vital; if so; die
    - Check if limb had other limbs attached to it; if so; remove them too
    - Drop limb on floor
        - Possible source of food
        - Change name of the corpse dropped (desecrated)

- Add limb grow (through magical means);
    - Add functions to add extra limbs
    - Add mutation potions that provide extra arms
        - If you grow extra arms, can't wear metal torso armor any longer
            - Maybe if you have some kind of welding/metalworking skill you can cut extra holes in the armor
                - Reduces defence by 20%, but allows you to wear it again.
        - However, you can wield extra items if you grow extra arms (i.e., more attacks)

# - Add decal;
    ## - Each creature either has blood
        ## - Blood color is set to red by default, can change
        ## - On hit, color creature tile in blood color
        ## - On hit, color random tile around the creature in blood color
        - Dissociate between internal wounds (no blood) and external wounds

- Add thirst system;
    - Find water, store water, all that good fun.
        - Decreases faster than hunger, takes less to fill up
        - Pyromancy increases thirst
